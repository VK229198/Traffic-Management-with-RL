# Phase 1

In the first phase we are going to collect a few ideas related to the subject, and read a few papers to understand the research gaps, and select a suitable topic to work on. 

## These are the potential ideas

- Topics
    - AI Driven network Security *
    - Quantum Networking Protocols
    - 6G and Network slicing optimization
    - Blockchain for Secure Networking
    - Autonomous Network Management using Reinforcement Learning *
    - Software Defined Networking (SDN) for Edge computing
    - Resilient Networks against Large-Scale Failures *
- Introduction
    1. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for detecting cyber threats, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, malware, or unauthorized access.
    2. Quantum networking uses quantum mechanics to enhance secure communication. One famous example is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which enables unbreakable encryption
    3. Network slicing is a key concept in 5G/6G that allows the creation of **virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure**. Different slices can be optimized for different applications.
    4. Using blockchain to enhance security and trust in networking. could be applied for decentralized ID Management, DDoS Protection, and secure IoT communication
    5. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enable **self-optimizing networks** that adapt dynamically based on real-time conditions. This is helful for Traffic Management.
    6. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, making networks programmable. Edge computing brings processing closer to users for lower latency and better performance.
    7. Designing networks that can **recover quickly from failures** like cyberattacks, natural disasters, or large-scale hardware failures.
- Possible Research Gaps
    1. An AI based IDS and IPS to prevent adversarial attacks and, making ML models with threat detection, that are lightweight with low processing power.
    2. Exploring hybrid classical-quantum networks to integrate quantum security with traditional networks.
    3. Dynamic allocation of resources (adjusting slices) based on demand. AI driven Network slicing for self-optimization.
    4. New and lightweight blockchain protocols for IoT.
    5. Developing faster-converging RL models for real-time network decision-making. Applying RL to specific use cases like satellite networks or vehicular networks.
    6. 
    7. AI-driven self-healing networks, Exploring multi-agent systems for dynamic failure recovery.

## Topic Chosen: AUTONOMOUS NETWORK MANAGEMENT USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

### What is Autonomous Network Management?

- Autonomous network management refers to self-governing networks that use AI and automation to configure, optimize, and troubleshoot themselves with minimal human intervention.

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

- Reinforcement Learning is a type of training machine learning model using trial and error( ML Paradigm), using a reward and punishment based system.

### What will we aim to do using this?

- We are going to use Reinforcement Learning to do traffic management of data packets for efficient communication

# Phase 2

In phase 2, we are going to research on the topic we have finalized on and read and review papers, related to the topic to understand the topic in depth, to identify the research gaps and future scope to further innovate on existing projects.

# Phase 3

In phase 3 we will be write the review paper, starting with abstract, then the introduction, background, the applications of reinforcement learning in network management, the future scope, the finally the conclusion.
